## Key Insights for Presentation

###### for presentation i focus on just know which age are most have heart disease and the gender of the people that have this disease
###### , focus on the most chest pain type , st_slop and fastingBS that make people have this disease or not
###### Afterwards, I introduce each of the categorical variables one by one. To start,
###### I use the histogram plots of age and gender count . I'm only looking at
###### the chest pain type plot here since it's the clearest example of how the
###### age  affect in heart disease .
